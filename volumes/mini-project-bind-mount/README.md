### Build and Run the Container

1. **Without Docker Compose**:
    - Build the Docker image:
        
        ```bash
        docker build -t bind-mount-app .
        ```
        
    - Run the container with the bind mount:
        
        ```bash
        docker run -d --name bind-mount-container -p 8000:8000 -v $(pwd)/html:/app bind-mount-ap
        ```

### Access the Application

- Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:8000`. You should see the "Hello from the Docker Bind Mount!" message from the `index.html` file.

### Modify Files in Real Time

- Now, modify the `html/index.html` file on your local machine, for example, change the `<h1>` content to something else:

```html
<h1>Hello from the Updated Bind Mount Example!</h1>
```

- Save the changes and refresh the browser (`http://localhost:8000`). The changes will be reflected immediately because of the bind mount.

### Explanation:

- **Bind Mount**: The `v $(pwd)/html:/app` in the `docker run` command or the `volumes` section in `docker-compose.yml` is what sets up the bind mount. The `html/` directory on your host is mapped to the `/app` directory inside the container.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Since this is a bind mount, any changes made to the `html/` folder on the host will immediately affect the container, so you can update the web content without rebuilding or restarting the container.
